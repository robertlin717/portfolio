      Pictures can be edited, memories recorded, and moments forever captured, all in a single frame. Photoshop is a tool that allows us to do this, and it has always been something that has captivated me. Art has always played some part in my life. Logos, apps, websites, and books frequently appear in our lives and brands everything we know today. Everything I do is a form of creative expression. Art, my action, helps me express myself instead of words; Art, an emotional creature, shows different sentiments that I had; Art, my world, records all the memories in my life; Art, the bravest human, provokes us to look at the world differently.
